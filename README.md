<h1>OTR-AC vs LGD-4: Which SARM Delivers Better Gains?</h1>

<p>In this article, I’m breaking down my personal results running two potent SARMs: <strong>OTR-AC</strong> and <strong>LGD-4</strong>. I’ve used both solo and in stacks, and I’ve kept detailed logs of how they hit, what side effects came up, and which one actually delivered better physique changes.</p>

<p>If you’re stuck trying to pick between these two — this guide is for you.</p>

<h2>What Are These SARMs?</h2>

<h3>OTR-AC (Ostarine-O-Acetate)</h3>
<p>OTR-AC is a modified version of Ostarine (MK-2866) with an acetate group added to increase its potency and absorption. It hits harder and faster than standard Ostarine — and it’s especially great for muscle retention and endurance during a cut.</p>

<h3>LGD-4</h3>
<p>LGD-4 is a next-gen version of Ligandrol (LGD-4033). It delivers serious muscle and strength gains while aiming to reduce androgenic side effects. It’s more aggressive than OTR-AC, but comes with more suppression risk too.</p>

<h2>How I Tested Them</h2>

<p>I ran each one for a 6-week solo cycle:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>OTR-AC:</strong> 20mg/day</li>
  <li><strong>LGD-4:</strong> 10mg/day</li>
</ul>

<p>Kept the diet tight — high-protein, clean carbs, training 5x/week, tracking strength and body comp changes.</p>

<h2>My OTR-AC Experience</h2>

<p>OTR-AC kicked in fast. Within the first week, I noticed tighter muscles, better stamina in the gym, and my shoulders and arms looked sharper. Strength gains were moderate — think 1-2 extra reps, not 20-lb jumps. But what really stood out was how lean everything felt. I dropped a little fat while holding muscle — exactly what I wanted on a cut.</p>

<p>I didn’t experience any shutdown symptoms. No libido crash, no mood swings, and no sleep issues. Honestly, it felt like a strong version of Ostarine with faster results.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, recomposition, first-timers</p>

<p><strong>Dose used:</strong> 20mg/day</p>

<p><strong>Where I got it:</strong> <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/otr-ac-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OTR-AC from Chemyo</a></p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fast-acting</li>
  <li>Great for muscle retention</li>
  <li>Little to no suppression</li>
  <li>Perfect for cutting</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Not ideal for bulking</li>
  <li>Strength gains are moderate</li>
</ul>

<h2>My LGD-4 Experience</h2>

<p>LGD-4 is a beast. I started feeling it by week 2 — bigger pumps, rapid strength increases, and a noticeable jump in scale weight. I gained about 6 pounds total, and the mirror showed most of it was lean mass. My legs and chest thickened up fast, and I had to increase working sets because I wasn’t getting sore anymore.</p>

<p>However, I did notice mild suppression by week 5. Libido dipped a bit, and energy was slightly off. Nothing severe — but noticeable. I ran a mini-PCT after and bounced back fully in a few weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Bulking, strength cycles</p>

<p><strong>Dose used:</strong> 10mg/day</p>

<p><strong>Where I got it:</strong> <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/lgd4/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LGD-4 from Chemyo</a></p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Rapid muscle growth</li>
  <li>Strength spikes</li>
  <li>Dry, clean gains</li>
  <li>Good for recomposition</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Moderate suppression</li>
  <li>Not ideal during a strict cut</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs: OTR-AC vs LGD-4</h2>

<h3>Which is stronger for muscle growth?</h3>
<p>LGD-4 easily. It's a mass-building SARM.</p>

<h3>Is OTR-AC suppressive?</h3>
<p>Very mildly. Most users don’t report needing a full PCT.</p>

<h3>Can I stack OTR-AC and LGD-4?</h3>
<p>Yes, but use lower doses of each. This stack can support muscle gain without extreme suppression.</p>

<h3>How fast does OTR-AC work?</h3>
<p>Faster than regular Ostarine. You’ll feel it within the first week.</p>

<h3>Do I need PCT after LGD-4?</h3>
<p>Yes. It causes mild-to-moderate suppression after 4-6 weeks.</p>

<h3>Which one has fewer side effects?</h3>
<p>OTR-AC is much lighter. LGD-4 is stronger, but comes with more hormonal impact.</p>

<h3>Where can I buy real OTR-AC or LGD-4?</h3>
<p>I used Chemyo for both — they publish third-party lab results and their purity is solid.</p>

<h2>Final Takeaway</h2>

<p><strong>LGD-4</strong> is for experienced users looking for serious gains and willing to run a light PCT.</p>

<p><strong>OTR-AC</strong> is for beginners, cutting phases, or anyone who wants safer results with minimal suppression.</p>

<p>Both are legit — it just depends on your goal. For bulk, go <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/lgd4/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LGD-4</a>. For lean cutting or mild cycles, go <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/otr-ac-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OTR-AC</a>.</p>

<p>Train hard. Stay consistent. Cycle smart.</p>
